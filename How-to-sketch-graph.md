# Create Network Architecture
Creation of flow is very simple just start like the usual neural network architecture having input layer containing 10 nodes, first hidden layer having 30 nodes, second demands 50 node and so on then finally output layer nodes equal to no. of classes.
start with dropping the 10 input nodes from the sidebar then drop 30 hidden node create link from input nodes to the dropped hidden node select multiple node and group them to one layer and so on...

### Functionalities:
* ***Create nodes:***<br>
Click on the ANN tab in the sidebar choose the type on node wanted to grab it and drop it to the workspace.
* ***Create Links:***<br>
For creating you should have at least two different types of nodes added to the workspace, click on the right bottom corner of the node(input and hidden) to create a link from the clicked node and drop it to the left bottom of the different node(output or hidden).
* ***Tune node Parameters:***<br>
Double click on the node of interest a drawer will open from the right-hand side of the window fill parameters and click save.
* ***Tune Link Parameters:***<br>
Double click on the link of interest a drawer will open from the right-hand side of the window fill parameters and click save.
* ***Train model:***<br>
Click the Get code to execute code at backend and see runtime result in tabs given at the bottom of the page.
* ***Execution configuration model:***<br>
Click the change exe config to save execution configuration.
